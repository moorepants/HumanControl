Description
===========

This is a human operator control model for a person controlling a bicycle. The
bicycle model is based on the Whipple bicycle dynamic model. The control
portion is based on the crossover model and includes basic preview. The model
is capable of tracking a path.

This software is the companion code to the publication:

File Descriptions
===================

`whipple_pull_force_abcd.m` : Generates the linearized Whipple model about the
upright constant velocity equilibrium point for various parameter sets. It
includes an additional lateral pull force input.

`par_text_to_struct.m` : Loads in a parameter file to Matlab's structure data
type.

`WhippleModel.mdl` : The simulink model which is used to calculate the gains,
the various transfer function for the open and closed loops, and the handling
qualities metric for both steer torque and roll torque inputs.

`generate_data.m` : Generates the data (transfer functions, simulation results,
and handling quality metric) by simulating and perturbing the Simulink model.

`create_ieee_paper_plots.m` : Generates most of the plots for our first journal
paper on the topic.

`fix_ps_linstyle.m` : [A file from the Matlab file
exchange](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/17928) for
improving plot lines.

`load_bikes.m` : Loads the data from `generate_data` for multiple bicycles and
speeds into one structure.

`ieee.m` : Loads the data needed for `create_ieee_paper_plots` and runs the
function. This is not part of `create_ieee_paper_plots` to faciltate the
separation of the data generation and the plotting mainly for debugging
purposes.

`lane_change.m` : Generates path data for a single or double lane change
manuever at a particular speed.

`benchmark_geometry_figure.m` : Generates a postscript drawing of the bicycle
dimenions. Requires [pshacker](http://bicycle.tudelft.nl/schwab/pshacker/).

Requirements
============

- Matlab 2010a (7.10.0)
- Matlab Control Systems Toolbox
- Simulink
- [pshacker](http://bicycle.tudelft.nl/schwab/pshacker/) (for the bicycle
  geometry plot)

Example Use
===========

The core function in this package is `generate_data.m`. The simplest method of
using it is to supply it with a bicycle name and a speed. It will then find the
appropriate gains for a stable model, compute all of the loop transfer
functions and simulate a double lane change manuever. The function outputs all
of this data for easy plotting and analysis.

Generate data for the Benchmark bicyle at 4.8 m/s.

```matlab
>> data = generate_data('Benchmark', 4.8);
```

You should see this basic output:

```

`data` is now a structure that contains all of the output from the function.

```matlab
>> data

data =

             speed: 4.8000
               par: [1x1 struct]
          modelPar: [1x1 struct]
       closedLoops: [1x1 struct]
         openLoops: [1x1 struct]
    handlingMetric: [1x1 struct]
              time: [209x1 double]
           command: [209x5 double]
            inputs: [209x3 double]
           outputs: [209x18 double]
        outputsDot: [209x18 double]
              path: [209x1 double]
          gainMuls: [1 1 1 1 1]

```

You can check the eigenvalues of the bicycle model:

```matlab
>> eig(data.modelPar.A)
```

The loop transfer functions (open and closed) can be visualized with a Bode
plot:

```matlab
>> bode(tf(data.closedLoops.delta.num, data.closedLoops.delta.den))
```

The handling quality metric can be accessed by:

```matlab
>> tf(data.handlingMetric.num, data.handlingMetric.den)
```

The inputs and outputs from the simulation can be be visualized with:

```matlab
>> figure(1)
>> plot(data.time, data.inputs)
>> figure(2)
>> plot(data.time, data.outputs)
```

The model gains can be accessed with:

```matlab
>> data.modelPar.kDelta
>> data.modelPar.kPhiDot
>> data.modelPar.kPhi
>> data.modelPar.kPsi
>> data.modelPar.kY
```

`generate_data.m` can also take many optional arguments.

```matlab
% Generate the data set for the Benchmark bicycle at 5.0 m/s with roll as the
% input.
data = generate_data('Benchmark', 5.0, 'input', 'Roll');

% Generate the data set for the Fisher bicycle at 7.5 m/s with steer input
% and show the graphs.
data = generate_data('Fisher', 7.5, 'input', 'Steer', 'plot', 1);

% Generate the data set for the Browser bicycle at 2.5 m/s with steer as an
% input and multiply the five gains by various values and show the graphs.
data = generate_data('Browser', 2.5, 'plot', 1, 'gainMuls', [1.1, 1.1, 0.9, 1.0, 0.8])

% Generate the data set for the Bianchi Pista bicycle at 7.5 m/s with steer as the
% input and a single lane change as the manuever.
data = generate_data('Pista', 7.5, 'laneType', 'single');
```

We used `generate_data.m` to create the data and plots for the journal paper on
the subject. Run `ieee.m` to generate all of the plots. This code has examples
of how to extract and plot all of the data that is made available from
`generate_data.m`

```matlab
% Generate the plots for the paper on this model.
