File Descriptions
=================

These files contain the parameter sets for several bicycles (which include a
rigid rider) for the benchmark bicycle model as reported in [Meijaard2007]_ as
a comma separated list. The filename should follow this format ``[bicycle short
name]Par.txt`` where 'bicycle short name' is a capitalized one word name for
the particular parameter set, e.g. ``BenchmarkPar.txt``. The variable names
inside the file must follow the same format as the example files. Most of the
files are generated with the BicycleParameters software package [Moore2012b]_.
